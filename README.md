3. Create application secret.
## Usage

    * Advanced Hunting query (query result should contain DeviceName and DeviceId fields)
    * CSV file (single Name column with machine FQDNs)
    * Devices list separated with commas
3. Confirm selection in PowerShell forms pop-up.
4. Choose action that you want to perform on **Selected Devices**, the following actions are currently available:
    * Specify device tag in text box and **Apply tag**.
